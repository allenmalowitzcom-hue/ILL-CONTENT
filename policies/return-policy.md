# Return Policy

Effective Date: 2026-01-31

## Limited Exceptions
We will consider a refund or replacement only if:
- The file is corrupted or cannot be opened; or
- The download link fails and we are unable to provide a working file.

If you experience one of the issues above, contact us within 7 days of purchase with your order number and a description of the problem. We will attempt to resolve the issue promptly by providing a working file. If we cannot provide a working file, we may issue a refund at our discretion.
